# Activity types
# It gives more detailed control over when a workflow will be triggered
# e.g for event Pull_Request -> opened, closed, edited

# Filters:
# More detailed control over when a workflow will be triggered
# e.g push Event -> filter based on target branch
# we donot want to trigger workflow when we push in branch rather than main branch
